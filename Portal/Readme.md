Learnings:
- If we want to do invert selection (The Invert Selection tool selects the inverse of the current selection: all unselected elements become selected, while the current selection becomes unselected), we use *Ctrl+I*
- If we want to separate elements away from surface, we do scaling along normals, *Alt+S*
- To extrude faces along normal, *Alt+E*
- To bevel vertices, select *V* after selecting bevel
- To slide the vertex in a particular direction, select any vertice and double-click *G*
- To link any modifier, we need to select the elements and the element from which we need to copy the modifier at the end and click *Ctrl+L*
- Wavy texture:
    - Displace modifier
    - Texture (wood)
    - Extra empty axis
- Snapping (rocks)
- If you use *Alt D* (duplicate linked) instead of Shift D, you'll be creating exact linked duplicates of the original selected objects, but this time if you edit one object then you'll also be editing its linked duplicates.
- Emission material
