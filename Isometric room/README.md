Isometric Room

Learnings:
- Bevel: A bevel is an effect that smooths out edges and corners.
- To duplicate things, like stairs, floor planks, we use Array modifier and increase the count. 
- To increase thickness in opposite to normal side, thickness should be in negative
- If you are having problems with mirroring: Go to Object Mode, Highlight the object that the mirroring should be centred around (highlight bed for the mirroring of the bedposts etc) right-click, choose "set Origin" and then choose "Origin to Geometry". Now blender know where the middle of your bed is and the mirroring of the bedposts should work. Also, make sure that the "Mirror object" in the Mirror modifier is set to the bed.
- While proportional editing, if your whole object is moving, it just means that proportional size is big, reduce it.
- To avoid scaling on any one axis, simply press S and then Shift+(whichever side you wanna restrict)
