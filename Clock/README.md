CLOCK

- It is rendered using Cycles
- It uses 24fps and has 80 frames, resulting in an animation of more than 3 seconds
- It uses the glass effect for clock frame

Learnings: 
- Learnt about animation curves and its importance in creating realistic animation
- Learnt about lighting and camera positioning
- Learnt that Eevee rendering it is not possible to get a proper glass effect, like you can get with Cycles rendering

Mistakes:
- Before rendering the animation, preview it with the camera view first.
Make sure that the camera resolution and position covers your model throughout the animation.
- Save your model continuously so that if blender crashes due to complete GPU usage, you don't lose your work.
