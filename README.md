# Blender-projects

This repository contains the .blend files for the various 3D models made in Blender, along with the final rendered image and animation if there.

Each directory also mentions the learnings and mistakes I made while creating that model.

Some general information:
- Cycles rendering is slow but the results are better
- If you render using cycles, the best way is to reduce the sample size a bit and if you have more frames to render, it is recommended to use cycles only if you can use GPU rendering.
- Less the fps(frame per second), longer the video length, longer the time it takes to render.
